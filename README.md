# Funnalph

The official repository of the Funnalph App Smart Contract on the Alephium Network. Owned and managed by The Dark Sun Labs.

Funnalph is a decentralized $ALPH based click-funnel application build on the Alephium Network. It allows the users to create permissionless and personalized click-funnels at the click of a button, and enables founders on the Alephium Network to raise operational funds to continue building on Alephium without tedious procedures or requirements. It also incentivizes the community for contributing to these projects, and the influencers on Alephium to promote them.
